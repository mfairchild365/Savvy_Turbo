Savvy_Turbo adds output caching to Savvy rendered content

Savvy content can be cached for faster rendering. Savvy_Turbo allows rendered
content to be cached, and recalled for subsequent requests. For basic use,
instead of creating a new Savvy object, create a Savvy_Turbo object. In models
you'd like to have cached, implement the CacheableInterface.
